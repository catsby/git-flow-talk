#Using Git-Flow

[Git-flow][1] is a set of git extensions which provide high-level repository operations that work according to [Vincent Driessen's][2] branching model.  
This branching model is widely in use among teams using git as their
means of source control, and serve as a guide to developing software in
a managed fashion.  

This presentation is broken into parts; a brief introduction, the main
branches, the supporting branches, and then some demo / references.

Estimated time: 5-7 minutes
